## Overview

**Epoch Rewards** is distributed to incentivize validators on MAP Relay Chain for keeping network safe, stable and smooth. The reward distribution is currently solely depended on validator's uptime performance. The team decides to add other metrics to improve fairness of reward distribution scheme.

## Motivation

The **total delegated votes** is a crucial factor for a validator. It can determine the election of a validator and it can also reflects a certain validator's node stability and uptime performance. Hence, the team decides to add **total delegated votes** as a new parameter in reward distribution calculation 

## Specification

The new distribution scheme will now be depended on two factors:

Let 

**P** = the weight of '**voteDelegated**' received by a validator;

**Q** = the weight of '**performanceScore**' got by a validator during epochs

then we have:
$$
P+Q = 1
$$
and the total reward distributed **T** to a validator is calculated as:
$$
T = totalRewards * (P * voteDelegated/totalVotes + Q * performanceScore/totalScores)
$$
where 

​	**totalRewards**' is the total rewards allocated for all validators during the epoch;

​	'**totalVotes**' is the amount of votes delegated to all validators ;

​	'**totalScores**' is the total scores earned by all validators during the epoch;

​	the current proposed value for **P** is 0.6;



The commission **C** generated by a validator during an epoch is also modified as followed:
$$
C =T * commssion * performanceScore
$$
where

​	'**commission**' is the parameter set by validator during registration;

​	'**performanceScore**' is used here to penalize validators without 100% uptime performance;

## Implementation

The modification of the reward distribution function will be in
