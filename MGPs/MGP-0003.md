## Overview

The Validator Committee is responsible for block proposing during each epoch. The current number of validators in Committee is 30 at the moment. 

## Motivation

Since there are more and more validators joining to the ecosystem, more chances and spots should be opened for new validators in every epoch.

## Specification

The parameter involved with the change is 

```solidity
   struct ElectableValidators {
        uint256 min;
        uint256 max;
    }
```

 The function that set the change is 

```solidity
    function setElectableValidators(uint256 min, uint256 max) public onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        require(0 < min, "Minimum electable validators cannot be zero");
        require(min <= max, "Maximum electable validators cannot be smaller than minimum");
        require(
            min != electableValidators.min || max != electableValidators.max,
            "Electable validators not changed"
        );
        electableValidators = ElectableValidators(min, max);
        emit ElectableValidatorsSet(min, max);
        return true;
    }
```



The proposed change to the function is 

```solidity
min = 1;
max = 40;
```

which means that there are 40 validators elected during an epoch.

## Implementation

The modification of the validator committee number will be in 

[Election.sol](https://github.com/mapprotocol/atlas-contracts/blob/main/contracts/governance/Election.sol)

## Security Considerations

None.
